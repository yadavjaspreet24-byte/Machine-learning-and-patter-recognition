######This repository presents a comprehensive study and implementation of distance-based classification algorithms, with a primary focus on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The main aim of this project is to understand how similarity measures influence classification performance and how different distance metrics impact model accuracy. The project also explores model evaluation techniques such as cross-validation and analyzes the bias-variance tradeoff in KNN to better understand model behavior.

######The methodology of this project begins with data preprocessing, including dataset loading, feature selection, and normalization where necessary to ensure fair distance computation. The KNN algorithm is then implemented using multiple distance metrics such as Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, and Cosine similarity. Different values of the parameter

######K are tested to observe how model complexity changes with neighborhood size. The model is evaluated using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and k-fold cross-validation to ensure reliable performance estimation and to reduce overfitting.

######Visualizations play an important role in supporting the findings of this project. Graphs such as the accuracy versus K value plot illustrate how performance varies with different neighbor sizes. Decision boundary visualizations demonstrate how the classifier separates classes under different configurations. Additionally, a bias-variance tradeoff graph helps explain how smaller values of K may lead to overfitting (high variance), while larger values may result in underfitting (high bias). These visual elements strengthen the analytical understanding of distance-based classification.

######The key findings of this project indicate that the choice of distance metric significantly influences classification accuracy. Feature scaling is crucial for improving performance when using distance-based algorithms. Smaller values of K generally provide more complex decision boundaries and may overfit the training data, whereas larger values produce smoother boundaries but may underfit. Cross-validation proves essential for obtaining a more reliable estimate of model generalization.

######In conclusion, this project demonstrates that KNN is a simple yet effective classification technique when properly configured. Selecting an appropriate distance metric, choosing an optimal value of K, and applying cross-validation are critical steps in achieving strong model performance. Distance-based classification remains a valuable and intuitive approach in machine learning, particularly for small to medium-sized datasets and educational applications.
